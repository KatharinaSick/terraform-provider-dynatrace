Please check the [documentation](https://dt-url.net/gy03cmt) for details.\n\nIt is recommended to enable the Unified services for OpenTelemetry to start benefitting from the improved automation and intelligence Unified Services provide to OpenTelemetry services.\n\n* Breaking change: This action will introduce new service metric keys, which will affect existing API metric queries, dashboards, and service names.\n* This action can be reverted.\n\nIf you already use the service type **Span (default) service** in your environment, we recommend migrating your instances to the **Unified service** type.",
