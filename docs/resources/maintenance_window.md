### Optional

- `description` (String) A short description of the maintenance purpose
- `enabled` (Boolean) The Maintenance Window is enabled or disabled
- `schedule` (Block List, Max: 1) The schedule of the maintenance window (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--schedule))
- `scope` (Block List, Max: 1) the tiles this Dashboard consist of (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--scope))
- `suppress_synth_mon_exec` (Boolean) Suppress execution of synthetic monitors during the maintenance
- `unknowns` (String) allows for configuring properties that are not explicitly supported by the current version of this provider

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--schedule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `schedule`

Required:

- `end` (String) The end date and time of the maintenance window validity period in yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm format
- `recurrence_type` (String) The type of the schedule recurrence. Possible values are `DAILY`, `MONTHLY`, `ONCE` and `WEEKLY`
- `start` (String) The start date and time of the maintenance window validity period in yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm format
- `zone_id` (String) The time zone of the start and end time. Default time zone is UTC. You can use either UTC offset `UTC+01:00` format or the IANA Time Zone Database format (for example, `Europe/Vienna`)

Required:

- `duration_minutes` (Number) The duration of the maintenance window in minutes
- `start_time` (String) The start time of the maintenance window in HH:mm format

Optional:

- `day_of_month` (Number) The day of the month for monthly maintenance.  The value of `31` is treated as the last day of the month for months that don't have a 31st day. The value of `30` is also treated as the last day of the month for February

<a id="nestedblock--scope--matches"></a>
### Nested Schema for `scope.matches`
