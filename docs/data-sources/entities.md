# dynatrace_entities (Data Source)

The entities data source allows all entities to be retrieved by its type.

- `type` (String) Type of the entity, e.g. SERVICE. All available entity types can be retrieved with [/api/v2/entityTypes](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/entity-v2/get-all-entity-types).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "dynatrace_entities" "Test" {
  type = "SERVICE"
}

output "Service_List" {
  value = data.dynatrace_entities.Test.entities
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `entity_selector` (String) An entity selector that filters the entities of interest. You cannot use `type` and `entity_selector` at the same time
- `from` (String) Limits the time frame entities are queried for - specifically the start of the requested timeframe. Defaults to `now-3y`. You can use one of the following formats:
  * Timestamp in UTC milliseconds
  * Human-readable format of `2021-01-25T05:57:01.123+01:00`. If no time zone is specified, `UTC` is used. You can use a space character instead of the `T`. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional
  * Relative timeframe, back from now. The format is `now-NU/A`, where `N` is the amount of time, `U` is the unit of time, and `A` is an alignment. The alignment rounds all the smaller values to the nearest zero in the past. For example, `now-1y/w` is one year back, aligned by a week. You can also specify relative timeframe without an alignment: `now-NU`. Supported time units for the relative timeframe are:
    - `m` for minutes
    - `h` for hours
    - `d` for days
    - `w` for weeks
    - `M` for months
    - `y` for years
- `to` (String) Limits the time frame entities are queried for - specifically the end of the requested timeframe. Defaults to `now`. You can use one of the following formats:
  * Timestamp in UTC milliseconds
  * Human-readable format of `2021-01-25T05:57:01.123+01:00`. If no time zone is specified, `UTC` is used. You can use a space character instead of the `T`. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional
  * Relative timeframe, back from now. The format is `now-NU/A`, where `N` is the amount of time, `U` is the unit of time, and `A` is an alignment. The alignment rounds all the smaller values to the nearest zero in the past. For example, `now-1y/w` is one year back, aligned by a week. You can also specify relative timeframe without an alignment: `now-NU`. Supported time units for the relative timeframe are:
    - `m` for minutes
    - `h` for hours
    - `d` for days
    - `w` for weeks
    - `M` for months
    - `y` for years
- `type` (String) The type of the entities to find, e.g. `HOST`. You cannot use `type` and `entity_selector` at the same time
