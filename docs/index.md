# Dynatrace Terraform Provider

The Dynatrace Terraform Provider is used to interact with the resources supported by the Dynatrace REST API. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the links to the left to learn about the available resources, data sources, and guides.

## Example

# Terraform 0.13+ uses the Terraform Registry:
```
terraform {
    required_providers {
        dynatrace = {
            version = "1.33.0"
            source = "dynatrace-oss/dynatrace"
        }
    }
} 
```
## Configure the Dynatrace provider
```
provider "dynatrace" {
    dt_env_url    = "https://########.live.dynatrace.com"
    dt_api_token  = "################"
}
```
where `dt_env_url` represents the URL of your Dynatrace Environment and `dt_api_token` needs to be an API Token with the following permissions:
* `Read configuration`
* `Capture request data`
* `Read SLO`
* `Read settings`
* `Read API tokens`
* `Read entities`
* `Read Geographic regions`
* `Read network zones`
* `Read synthetic locations`
* `Read synthetic monitors, locations, and nodes`
* `Capture request data`
* `Read credential vault entries`
* `Access problem and event feed, metrics and topology`
* `Read synthetic monitors, locations, and nodes`
* `Write settings`
* `Write API tokens`
* `Write entities`
* `Write network zones`
* `Write SLO`
* `Write synthetic locations`
* `Write credential vault entries`
* `Change data privacy settings`
* `Create and read synthetic monitors, locations`
* `Write configuration`



## Exporting existing configuration from a Dynatrace Environment
In addition to acting as a Terraform Provider Plugin, the executable `terraform-provider-dynatrace` (`terraform-provider-dynatrace.exe` on Windows) can be directly invoked.
The utility reaches out to the Dynatrace Environment specified by the command line arguments and fetches all currently supported configuration items. These results will then automatically get transformed into HCL (the configuration language to be used for `.tf` files) and places each configuration item into its own `.tf` file.

With release 1.15.0, a new and improved version of the export utility is now available with various improvements (outlined below).
* Data source references automatically generated in resources
* Data source blocks created for dependencies in data_source.tf file(s)
* Creation of all resources required based off of dependencies
* Resources organized in modules with preconfigured main.tf based on output
* Pre-populated providers.tf file in the parent folder and all modules
* Option to include ID as a commented line in generated resources
* Option to include/exclude specific resource IDs from export
* Ability to convert from HCL to JSON formatted files
 
Please provide any feedback of the export utility via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/terraform-provider-dynatrace/issues). 

**Export Utility documentation has been moved under Guides [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/guides/export-v2).**
